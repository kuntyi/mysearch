What was wrong in old version of module:
- wrong name of file "mysearch.module.php", module file must be in "*.module" format
- in hook_menu wrong url format, it should end with % and there must be 'page arguments' for transfer search argument to function
- main function mysearch_searchpage must take on search argument
- title in main page must sets in hook_menu, for dynamic title i have use 'title callback' function and 'title arguments'
- query in main function wrong and use standard query is wrong way
- load each node in cycle will make many query to db it's wrong way too
- to make link better way it's to use l() function
- to make link theme('item_list')
- use print_r in module not correct

What could be done:
- templates for results
- options to use revisions
- options to count of display and sorting
- admin section to set options
- link from module install to admin section and permissions
- indexing content for smaller loads
- automatic table creating in db when module install

Considering 1 hour estimate, I think that coped with task.
